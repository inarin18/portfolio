            In this project, we developed a model to predict bank app review scores and 
            won a silver medal in the Signate competition.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilized quantitative and qualitative data from user reviews and "like" counts</li>
            <li>Implemented an LLM (Large Language Model) to process natural language variables</li>
            <li>Achieved a silver medal by developing a high-accuracy prediction model</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Python: Main programming language</li>
            <li>PyTorch: Building and training deep learning models</li>
            <li>Transformers: State-of-the-art models for natural language processing tasks</li>
            <li>Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics</li>
            <li>Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical computations</li>
        </ul>
